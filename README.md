A register based virtual machine built using Rust.

### About
This is a side project of mine that I am working on for fun. Currently I am following a [tutorial](https://blog.subnetzero.io/post/building-language-vm-part-01/) to familiarize myself with vmâ€™s. I plan on adding my own features and optimizations at a later date.
